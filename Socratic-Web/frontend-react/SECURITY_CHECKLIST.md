# Frontend Security Checklist

This document outlines security best practices for the React frontend application.

## Pre-Deployment Security Checklist

### Environment Variables

- [ ] Create a `.env.production` file for production-specific variables
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables are prefixed with `VITE_` for Vite to expose them
- [ ] Set proper backend API URL (`VITE_PRODUCTION_BACKEND_URL`)
- [ ] Verify Firebase configuration is set correctly for production
- [ ] Do NOT include any API keys or secrets that should remain server-side

### Security Headers

- [ ] Configure appropriate Content Security Policy (CSP)
- [ ] Enable Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- [ ] Set proper X-Content-Type-Options header
- [ ] Configure X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking

### Authentication

- [ ] Verify Firebase authentication is properly configured
- [ ] Implement proper token handling and refresh logic
- [ ] Ensure authentication state persists appropriately
- [ ] Test login, logout, and session expiration flows

### API Communication

- [ ] Verify all API calls use HTTPS
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for failed API requests
- [ ] Validate data from API responses before displaying to users
- [ ] Ensure sensitive API requests include authentication tokens

### Input Validation

- [ ] Validate all user inputs on the client-side
- [ ] Implement proper form validation
- [ ] Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- [ ] Verify file uploads are properly restricted (if applicable)

### Dependency Security

- [ ] Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerable dependencies
- [ ] Update dependencies to resolve any security issues
- [ ] Remove unused dependencies

## Build Process

1. **Create Production Build:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Verify Build Output:**
   - [ ] Check that the build completes successfully
   - [ ] Verify assets are properly minified and optimized
   - [ ] Test the production build locally before deployment

3. **Static Analysis:**
   - [ ] Run linters to check for code quality issues
   - [ ] Consider using security-focused linters

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Deploy to a secure hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- [ ] Configure custom domain with HTTPS
- [ ] Set up proper redirects (especially for SPA routing)
- [ ] Configure caching policies appropriately
- [ ] Set up continuous integration/deployment with security checks

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Run Lighthouse security audit
- [ ] Test application on multiple browsers and devices
- [ ] Verify all API calls are working correctly
- [ ] Check for any console errors or warnings
- [ ] Perform basic load testing

## Security Best Practices to Maintain

1. **Regular Updates:**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Schedule regular security reviews
   - Stay informed about security issues in dependencies

2. **Monitoring:**
   - Implement error tracking (e.g., Sentry)
   - Monitor for unusual activity patterns
   - Track API usage and error rates

3. **Ongoing Testing:**
   - Regularly retest authentication flows
   - Check for new vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Perform periodic security scans
